# Physics-Informed Adversarial Training of Neural Networks (PIAT)
**What is PIAT?**

PIAT minimizes an adversarial loss for training physics informed neural networks:

# Experimental codes
We have applied PIAT for solving Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Sawadaâ€“Kotara equation, and a high dimensional heat equation. The codes are available in this repository.

These codes can be easily run in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
